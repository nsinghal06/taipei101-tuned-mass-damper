# Taipei101-Tuned-Mass-Damper
This project analyzes how the 660-ton tuned mass damper (TMD) installed in Taipei 101 mitigates wind-induced oscillations in the skyscraper. The project combines mathematical modeling, Python simulations, and engineering analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of TMDs in reducing structural sway. Developed as part of MAT187 Calculus II Mini-Project.

## ðŸ“– Overview  
- Modeled Taipei 101 as a **2-DOF mass-spring-damper system** using Newtonâ€™s Second Law.  
- Derived and analyzed **coupled differential equations** representing building motion with and without a TMD.  
- Implemented **Python simulations (NumPy, )** to evaluate dynamic responses under sinusoidal wind loads to compare displacement of the building alone vs. coupled with the TMD.
- Documented findings in a technical report integrating mathematical derivations, computational analysis, and real-world implications for structural engineering.

## ðŸ“Š Key Results  
- Without a TMD, Taipei 101 experiences steadily increasing displacement under harmonic wind loads.  
- With a 660-ton TMD tuned to the buildingâ€™s natural frequency, oscillations are **out of phase**, significantly reducing displacement and improving stability.  
- Simulations confirm that the TMD absorbs and dissipates a large portion of wind energy, validating its effectiveness as an engineering solution.
